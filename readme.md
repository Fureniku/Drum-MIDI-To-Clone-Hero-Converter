Drum MIDI to Clone Hero Chart converter

Converts MIDI files which contain drums to the Clone Hero Chart format to speed up drum charting.

Includes pro drums and automatic 2x kick processing.

Licence wise, do whatever you want with it, it didn't take long to make. If you do do something though I'd love to know just from curiosity!
